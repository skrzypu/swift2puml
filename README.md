# swift2puml
This project is to generate UML diagrams written in PlantUML from swift code.  
It is written in python as it is multiplatform and allows easy manipulate data.

Project on which I want base:
plantuml
https://github.com/bschwarz/omskep  
https://github.com/palaniraja/swiftuml  

It should only generate diagrams.  

In long term there should be create application like Doxygen for c++. SourceKit should allow that as it keeps not only code, but also documentation.
